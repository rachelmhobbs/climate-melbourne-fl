# climate-melbourne-fl

**Version 1.0**

The end goal of this project is a web application using Django that compares simple climate data from 2019 between Melbourne, FL and San Diego, CA. 
This project was built for Trabus Technologies.

Version 1.0 contains the basic data analysis functions which then run for each csv file, and a plot of time versus temperature for Melbourne, FL.
